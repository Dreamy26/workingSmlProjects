# workingSmlProjects

I will be working through small projects to help build my 
foundational learning, solving algorithms.
### How ðŸ¥¸
    I will practice using small coding exercises.
    1. Identify a problem
    2. Set a timer (45 min)
    3. work out solving using pen and paper first
    4. Identify a Coding sandbox to use, to check code after working through to the solution.
    
### Exposing ðŸ¥´
    I need to fell more comfortable with sharing my thoughts during solving problems.  I often find myself stuck thinking.. Not that it is a bad action. 
    However, while working with a partner I leave them guessing my next move.  
    
    I should also feel more comfortable with sharing the algorithm that I have identified as a possible algorithm.
    
### Languages
- C# ( ðŸ¥° )
- Python ( ðŸ™ƒ )

### Exercises that will be worked on
- Defining and calling a function
- Specify different input and output argument types
- Iterate over different collections (arrays, lists, sets, strings)
- Type conversions (how do I convert a char to string, a string to int, etc ...)
