# workingSmlProjects

I will be working through small projects to help build my 
foundation for learning more about solving algorithms.

### Languages
- C# ( ðŸ¥° )
- Python ( ðŸ™ƒ )

### Resources
[leetCode the Right Way](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-practice-leetcode-problems-right-way-anthony-d-mays/?trackingId=SiVmnY7BTJWj4Pd5G170Pw%3D%3D)

### Exercises that will be worked on
- Defining and calling a function
- Specify different input and output argument types
- Iterate over different collections (arrays, lists, sets, strings)
- Type conversions (how do I convert a char to string, a string to int, etc ...)
