# workingSmlProjects

I will be working through small projects to help build my 
foundational learning, solving algorithms.
### How ðŸ¥¸
    I will practice using small coding exercises.
    1. Identify a problem
    2. Set a timer (45 min)
    3. work out solving using pen and paper first
    4. Identify a Coding sandbox to use, to check code after working through to the solution.
    5. Document problem in current README.md
    6. Document practice code in current README.md.. (Take a few ðŸ‘  ðŸ‘Ÿ ðŸ‘¢ steps with me)

### Methods to use
What are the expected values for each 
I = Input
O = Output
E = Edge Cases
A = Assumptions, are where you gain clarity with the interviewer.

Tip: draw out your understanding

### Exposing ðŸ¥´
    I need to fell more comfortable with sharing my thoughts during solving problems.  I often find myself stuck thinking.. Not that it is a bad action. 
    However, while working with a partner I leave them guessing my next move.  
    
    I should also feel more comfortable with sharing the algorithm that I have identified as a possible algorithm.
    
### Languages
- C# ( ðŸ¥° )
- Python ( ðŸ™ƒ )

### Exercises that will be worked on
- Main method
    - public static void Main(string[] args)
- Defining/Declaring and calling a function
    - <visibility (public)> <return type (void, string, int, bool) <name (camelCase)> (<parameters> (string sentence, string charsss))
    {
        string result = sentence + charsss;
        return result;
    }
- Specify different input and output argument types
    - Console.WriteLine("This string sentence is and OUTPUT!");
    - string howAboutAnInput;
        - howAboutAnInput = Console.ReadLine();
- Iterate over different collections (arrays, lists, sets, strings)
- Type conversions (how do I convert a char to string, a string to int, etc ...)
